<li>Second one is super fast and intelligent.You run my Python program.You just type <i>username</i> of a person and boom
          you are done, all the repositories of that <i>username</i> along with info and data are printed on your screen.Then you
          just type the correct <i>repo_no</i> to access and see all the contents of that repo along with <i>URL.</i>Well, pretty nice
            huh?</li>
